# Covid-19
Covid-19 Detection with the help of X-ray scans (TensorFlow)

This is just an attempt from my side to solve this severe problem.

Primary Dataset used: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset ( Please try to contribute to this dataset )
As the dataset contains only a few images, I had to use a another x-ray images dataset(for healthy person)( https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia ).

I have used two models ( VGG Net and Resnet 50).

Please feel free to contribute.
